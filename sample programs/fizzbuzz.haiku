The willows blossom... the willows like serene days... the monkeys born now...
Monkeys like warm sun- bright, active play. Monkeys like- monkeys breed bright joy...
Monkeys like monkeys- breed monkeys. The oak blossoms... oak like bright, great, tall-
healthy plant. such is- the nature of life: beauty... no comparison...
The sapling blossoms... sapling like tall, healthy plant... what might the plants have...
Seasons pass, willows- underneath monkeys, we see...with willows spare oak-
seed sapling and naught... the day's wind howls 'fizzbuzz'... but with willows spare -
sapling and naught. seas- howls 'buzz' but with willows - spare the oak and naught...
wolves howls 'fizz' but- the wind all howls willows... then willows like tall-
willows. Soon all the- seasons end. The forest calms... serene bliss, good night...
